# Hoody.com Launches Hoody AI: Every AI, One Dashboard, Anonymous

**Ensures Confidentiality as AI Becomes Universally Accessible**

October 3, 2024 — Hoody.com, an innovator in privacy technologies known for launching Hoody BETA in 2023, is proud to announce a new flagship product: **Hoody AI**. This groundbreaking platform redefines how users interact with artificial intelligence by providing private, anonymous, and encrypted access to top-tier AI models, including the latest OpenAI Strawberry, Claude Sonnet, Meta LLaMA3, and Google Gemini Pro.

As the AI landscape becomes increasingly fragmented with multiple providers, managing access to multiple AI platforms is becoming costly, inconvenient, and a privacy dilemma. Hoody AI addresses these challenges by offering a unified interface that provides direct access to the best AI models, eliminating the need for multiple subscriptions while ensuring 100% anonymity for users—**no name or email required**.

## A New Era of Private AI Usage

- **Free to Use**: Hoody AI is available for free with generous usage limits, with premium plans offering unlimited access and more models.
- **Anonymous Access**: 30-second signup with absolutely zero information required. Users' prompts are inaccessible to anyone else.
- **One Interface**: Interact simultaneously with top models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta...) through a single, feature-rich dashboard designed for ultimate convenience.
- **Voice Support**: Speak directly to any AI using your microphone, and let AI respond to you with adjustable voice settings.
- **Image & Document Analysis**: Upload files and ask questions about them, extract information, and even summarize documents.

Hoody AI has quickly gained **popularity** following its launch, securing a spot as one of the **top 2 weekly products on Product Hunt**, with more than **10,000 anonymous Keys created** in the same week. This achievement highlights Hoody AI's value and its unique approach to addressing the new challenges emerging from the democratization of AI.
